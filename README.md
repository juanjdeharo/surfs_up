# Surfs Up

## Overview of the Analysis

> W. Avy wants me to look into the weather in Oahu for the months of June and December to see if the ice cream shop could be open year-round

## Results

> The temperatures in Oahu for June and December are actually very similar in terms of their mean, around 75 degrees in June and around 71 degrees in December, both of which are good temperatures for Ice Cream, however the low for December is 56 which starts to be too cold for ice creamm.

## Summary

> Oahu seems like a great place to open an Ice Cream store. If you wanted to check further I would look into how often it rains in those months, or how often it is cloudy.
